# üí´ About Me:
My name is Seemant Kamlapuri, a driven and skilled Frontend Developer with a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from BBDNITM, Lucknow, maintaining an impressive 8.0 GPA. I am currently a Software Developer at Techpix Software Solutions (formerly Doorpix), where I contribute to the development of ERP systems and e-commerce web applications using technologies such as Next.js, React.js, and React Query.

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience through various internships. At The Redx Technologies Ltd., I honed my skills in designing and implementing web services and APIs using the MERN stack, while collaborating with cross-functional teams. During my time at Skillark Pvt Ltd., I worked on an online exam portal, demonstrating my ability to create reusable UI components and design robust database schemas.

In addition to my professional experience, I have undertaken significant projects like SK Media, a social media web application, and GroShop Ecom, an e-commerce platform, showcasing my proficiency in React.js, Node.js, and Firebase among other technologies.

As a Web Development Lead for the Google Developer Students Club at BBDNITM, I coordinated several successful events, earning recognition from faculty and peers for my leadership and organizational skills. My technical toolkit includes languages like C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as frameworks and tools such as Git/GitHub, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.

I am passionate about leveraging my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities to create impactful web applications and am always eager to learn and grow in the dynamic field of web development.
